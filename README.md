# Snake Game
The Snake Game is a terminal-based project developed for Computer Engineering Principles of Programming at McMaster University. (Grade: A+)

The project implements Object Oriented Programming concepts, such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to design a modular codebase. This uses data structures like array lists for a dynamic snake representation and is organized into distinct classes for the snake, food, and game mechanics. The Snake Game project reflects my strong proficiency in C++, object-oriented programming, and game design.
